   	<header><strong>The Ultimate Mish-Mash of Goodness</strong></header>
	<p>There are many different types of food that come to mind when presented with the term, "Mish-Mash".
Soup, salad, lasagna. Those are arguably delicious when prepared correctly. However, there can be no doubt in our minds that jambalaya is truly one of the most delicious concoctions ever created in the kitchen. I theorize it was  likely created initally purely because somebody needed to get rid of the food in their pantry.  With it's delcious combination of sausage, shrimp, rice, and delicious cajun herbs and spices, it brings to mind sweet southern banter along with rough and tumble play in the swamps of Lousiana. Some may even be deceived by it's seemingly
simple premise: throw a bunch of ingredients together and pray to God it tastes good. However, that couldn't be further from the trough. Though truly a mish mash, one should not underestimate the pure and delicious power of a well
crafted plate/bowl of homemade jambalaya and the top notch ingredients that go into it.  Jambalaya is truly the epitome of improvisational soul food that stands the test of time. </p>
