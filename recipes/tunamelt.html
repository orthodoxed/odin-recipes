        <p>Tuna melts are arguably one of the best foods that have ever been created.
            Balancing savory cheesiness with the delectably healthy tuna-fish, it's a
            all by itself. With the addition of select spices to enhance the already
            natural flavors present, it's a grand champion of foods that everyone
            can enjoy. The ingredients couldn't be simpler to start with: tuna fish and cheese.
            Two ingredients that nearly everyone has access to at all times of the year
            and any time of the day. Constantly stocked in our refridgerators in the event
            that we're called by the sandwich gods to create the one true sandwich.
