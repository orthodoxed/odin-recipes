        <p>Tuna melts are arguably one of the best foods that have ever been created.
            Balancing savory cheesiness with the delectably healthy tuna-fish, it's a
            all by itself. With the addition of select spices to enhance the already
            natural flavors present, it's a grand champion of foods that everyone
            can enjoy. The ingredients couldn't be simpler to start with: tuna fish and cheese.
            Two ingredients that nearly everyone has access to at all times of the year
            and any time of the day, constantly stocked in our refridgerators in the event
            that we're called by the sandwich gods to create the one true sandwich.
            Let us delve into the simplistic world of the delicious tuna melt.

        <header><strong>Steps</strong></header>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare your tuna fish in the way you like it (I like to mix my tuna
                    together with mayo, salt, pepper, garlic salt, and pickles/relish)
                </li>
                <li>Begin heating a small skillet over low-medium heat with approximately 1 tbsp of
                    butter
                </li>
                <li>While the skillet is heating up, begin slicing your cheese of choice
                    into thing squares approximately the
                    size of your bread slices, and melt some additional butter
                    in the microwave to spread on the bread (this is for when
                    we flip the bread to cook the other side)
                </li>
                <li>Place your cheese slices on your bread <strong>first</strong> and then
                begin spreading your tuna mixture over the cheese. Place additional slices
                of cheese over the tuna spread for full cheesie coverage</li>
                <li>Wait until the butter in the skillet has melted completely</li>
                <li>Place your prepared sandwich on the skillet. If it's smoking profusely
                    (think burger on a grill), your a bit too hot but don't worry! Even a
                    burnt tuna melt is delicious.
                </li>
                <li>Cook one side of your sandwich for approximately 3 - 4 minutes (the cheese
                    should noticeably be melting by this point), spreading your melted butter on
                    the other side while you wait.
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> place something weighted on top of the sandwich
                    while it cooks (even using your spatula) to cook through the sandwich quickly
                    and uniformly!
                </li>
                <li>Once it looks ready, flip your sandwich and cook for another 3 - 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Keep an eye on your cheese; is it pouring onto the skillet? Then your ready! Turn off the heat
                    and place your sandwich on your plate.
                </li>
                <li>Cut your sandwich in half, let cool for a minute, and enjoy!</li>
