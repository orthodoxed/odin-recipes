# odin-recipes

For this project, I'll be taking a look at some of my favorite foods and my favorite recipes. To do this, not only will I have comprehensive lists of each ingredient, I'll have beautiful pictures showcasing these delicious dishes in all of their foodie glory.

I would like to add that I love food and I love cooking. I believe that outside of learning things that keep me busy and satisfied, one of the most satisfying things about being alive is feeding myself and my family with delicious food.

UPDATE 8/8/2022:
I attempted to continue with TOP and the lessons through Kali Linux on a local virtual machine. Unfortnately it become a bit too much of a headache attempting to parse enough space on my local hard drive (which isn't exactly limited, but I'm wary of allocating more space).
Moving forward I'll be using my Raspberry Pi4 and using almost purely the command line interface. This will hopefully prevent further space issues for now, and allow me to build up my CLI chops and utilize other text editors for future use.
