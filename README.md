# odin-recipes

For this project, I'll be taking a look at some of my favorite foods and my favorite recipes. To do this, not only will I have comprehensive lists of each ingredient, I'll have beautiful pictures showcasing these delicious dishes in all of their foodie glory.

I would like to add that I love food and I love cooking. I believe that outside of learning things that keep me busy and satisfied, one of the most satisfying things about being alive is feeding myself and my family with delicious food.
